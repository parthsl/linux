sched/core: Add new tracepoint to track waker_cpu for sched_wakeup event

sched:sched_wakeup trace events provides information about the time and the
target_cpu of a waking task. But the wakeup can be done asynchornously by
target_cpu itself when the waker_cpu and target_cpu do not share cache, it
becomes impossible to find a waker_cpu from this even alone.

So, add a new tracepoint in ttwu_queue() to keep track of the waker_cpu
responsible for the sched_wakeup events. This is exported as an event but
needs to be registered and define prototype as an external module.
