sched/fair: Paraphrase idle-cpu classification for available_idle_cpu

The available_idle_cpu() differentiates between the CPUs which are idle or
which has VCPU preempted. With the addition of sched_idle_cpu() checks,
there are several code-paths where this both checks are used in conjunction
with each other. So paraphrase the available_idle_cpu() to allow
classification of different CPU Idle types.

cpu_idle_type is arranged in reverse order of their priority to be used for
task enqueueing, i.e.
1. CPU is busy
2. CPU is idle but VCPU may have been preempted
3. CPU is available for queueing and VCPU is non-preempted
4. CPU is running SCHED_IDLE class task(s)
