sched/fair: Provide arch hook to find domain for non idle core search scan

Specify the method which returns cpumask within which to limit the
search for a non idle core. By default, limit the search in LLC domain
which usually includes few/all the cores in the processor chip.

The select_non_idle_core searches for the non idle cores in the LLC domain.
But in the systems with multiple NUMA domains, the Turbo frequency can be
sustained within the NUMA domain without being affected from other
NUMA. For such case, arch_turbo_domain can be tuned to change domain for
non idle core search.
