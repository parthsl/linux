sched/core: Add manual background task classification using sched_setattr syscall

Small background tasks typically performs some housekeeping work and are
less important in the overall scheme of load balancing and scheduling.

So provide a way to mark the task which are small background noises with
the use of additional flag to the existing task attribute. Also provide an
interface from the userspace which uses sched_setattr syscall to mark such
tasks.

The scheduler may use this as hints to pack such tasks on fewer number of
cores.
