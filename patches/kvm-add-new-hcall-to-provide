kvm: Add new hcall to provide hint if a vcpu can be scheduled instantly.

H_IDLEHINT is a new hcall introduced to provide a hint to the guest of whether a
vcpu can be scheduled instantly or not. This is currently done by looking at the
prev_cpu of the task corresponding to a vcpu (which will be optimized in
future).
