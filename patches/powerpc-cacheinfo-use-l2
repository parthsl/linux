powerpc/cacheinfo: Use L2 cache_map to find group_id of a cpu in level-3

In POWER10 processor, since "ibm,thread-groups" property "2" indicates
sharing of both L2 and L3 cache in a thread-group, use the same
"thread_gropu_l2_cache_map" for deciding L3 group id. Thus all CPUs with
same group id are considered to be siblings in the L3 cache as well.
