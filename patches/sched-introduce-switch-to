sched: Introduce switch to enable TurboSched for task packing

Create a static key which allows to enable or disable TurboSched feature at
runtime.

This key is added in order to enable the TurboSched feature only when
required. This helps in optimizing the scheduler fast-path when the
TurboSched feature is disabled.

Also provide get/put methods to keep track of the tasks using the
TurboSched feature and also refcount classified background tasks. This
allows to enable the feature on setting first task classified as background
noise, similarly disable the feature on unsetting of such last task.
