kernel/idle: Update and use idle-hint in VPA region

In guest, Set idle_hint to 1 when the prev_cpu of a vCPU goes into idle state,
similarly set idle_hint to 0 when exiting an idle state.

Since the idle_hint is in VPA region, the available_idle_cpu() in guest can
read this region every time to find if a vCPU can be scheduled instantly by
the hypervsior or not.
