sched/idle: Add debugging bits to validate inconsistency in latency
sensitive task calculations

We monitor the task entering/exiting the scheduler, but there might be
unhandled situations which can lead to inconsistent value of the
nr_lat_sensitive counter. This may lead to restricting the use of IDLE
states despite absence of any latency sensitive workload.
Hence, add pr_info() if a negative value of nr_lat_sensitive value is found.
