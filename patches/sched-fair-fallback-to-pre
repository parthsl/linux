sched/fair: Fallback to pre-empted idle CPU in absence of any available_idle_cpu

select_idle_sibling finds available_idle_cpu() in LLC domain, but the definition
of available_idle_cpu() includes the CPU has nr_running=0 and
!vcpu_is_preempted(). In absence of any such available_idle_cpu, it returns
target cpu itself which is definitely not available_idle_cpu().

Hence, fallback to idle_cpu() in absence of any such available_idle_cpu(), which
better spreads the workload during task wakeup therby decreasing latency.

This patch implicitly fixes accounting problem which was not measured when
select_idle_sibling returns -1 at nr=0.
