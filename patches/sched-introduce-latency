sched: Introduce latency-nice as a per-task attribute

Latency-nice indicates the latency requirements of a task with respect
to the other tasks in the system. The value of the attribute can be within
the range of [-20, 19] both inclusive to be in-line with the values just
like task nice values.

latency_nice = -20 indicates the task to have the least latency as
compared to the tasks having latency_nice = +19.

The latency_nice may affect only the CFS SCHED_CLASS by getting
latency requirements from the userspace.
