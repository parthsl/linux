sched/fair: Allow pre-empted idle CPUs to be used for waking tasks

Pre-empted idle CPUs are not considered for task wakeup as the vCPU is
guaranteed to be really idle. Hence, optimize the wakeup path when the
select_idle_cpu and select_idle_smt is not able to find any CPU and so use
the pre-empted idle CPU (if any available) instead.
